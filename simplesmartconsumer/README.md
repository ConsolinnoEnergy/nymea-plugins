# Simple Smartconsumer

**Attention: This version of the simple smartconsumer interface is only working with Leaflet 1U0022.**

This plugin allows to create an simple smartconsumer interface based on a GPIO pin connected to a smart consumer.

The GPIO need to be connected to the high power contactor which powers the smart consumer.
